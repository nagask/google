1. Revise the working and use  of popular data structures like linked list, trees (binary, treap, (red  black, avl : optional)), priority queues, heap (min, max heaps), stack,  hashtable
2. Learn the equivalent of these theoretical data structures in the language of your choice. e.g. in Java you have HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeSet, HashSet, etc.
3. Learn the implementation differences in these as you have to write real code, not pseudo code during the interview.
4. Go through standard algorithms which you learn in school e.g. different sorting algorithms, graph traversals, MST, shortest path, etc.
5. Learn Big O notation and make sure you can deduce the time complexity of any algorithm (at least the ones you write)
6. Pay attention to space complexity. Edit 1: This is really important. You will realize this when you actually write code. The amount of space wasted in auxiliary data structures, and random arrays and hashmaps for various purposes is phenomenal.
7. Practice implementing 1, 2 in the language of your choice. During implementation, try to write code without external reference for things like getting console input, file operations and so on. If you do refer, make sure you don't have to look again. Edit 1: This would really get you into the comfort zone of the language that you, till date, thought you were an expert at.
8. Implement different versions each optimized for time or space complexity as you will be given problems in which input takes a lot of space and need a lot of time to parse. So you need to think in 2 dimensions (time and memory footprint. Edit 1: For example, try to implement in-place versions of the various sorting algorithms you studied.
